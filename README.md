<strong>Lab 2 – Combinational Circuit &amp; Boolean Simplification  </strong>

Design a circuit such that it will output 1, if the sum of the number’s decimal digits is 5 or 7. The input is 5-bit numbers.

For instance, if the input is 14 or 25 the sum is 1 + 4 = 5 and 2 + 5 = 7, therefore the output is 1.  For instance, if the input is 17, the sum is 1 + 7 = 8 so the output is 0.




<ol>

 <li>First draw the truth table for this problem.</li>

 <li>Then write down the Boolean expression for the output where each row is represented as a product term in sum of products form.</li>

 <li>Then simplify the resultant Boolean expression. During simplification you have to use one XNOR gate where A XNOR B = A’B’ + AB.</li>

 <li>Design your resultant simplified circuit using Logisim.</li>

 <li>Simulate your resultant circuit to be sure it works flawless.</li>

</ol>

<strong>Rules: </strong>

You have to make simplifications so that you use as few gates as possible.

You have to use only the inverters, 2-input and 3-input logic gates in your Logisim design.

DO NOT USE ANALYZE CIRCUIT PROPERTY OF LOGISIM. Otherwise you get a very low score.

<strong>Demo Session: </strong>

During demo, explain and simulate each step of your design. Do not forget you only have at most 4 minutes for that. Also you will answer any questions asked by the TA.
